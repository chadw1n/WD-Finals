## Overview

This portfolio demonstrates my web design and UX design skills by combining clean layout design, custom-designed logos and backgrounds, hover effects, flip card animations, and light-based transitions. The site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring life to each section while ensuring the layout is responsive and user-friendly.

One highlight of this project is the use of hover animations including a light hover glow on the Hero Title and creative elements like flip cards with JavaScript-based interactions, synced hover highlights, and animated image entrances.

Each page presents personal content, while the styling choices reflect both technical skill and a strong understanding of visual design, usability, and user experience (UX).


### Key Components
- Multi Page Website
- Global navigation and footer are consistent across all pages
- Uses a smooth JavaScript animation to fade in the intro elements.
- Text shimmer effect on hover (animated gradient reveal)
- Button hover effects 
- Animated social icons hover effect
- Skill bars with JavaScript on page load to animate progress bars smoothly
- 3D Flip Card Animation
- Logo bounce hover effect
- Preview Toggle

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
